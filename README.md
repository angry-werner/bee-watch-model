# bee-watch-model

This package intends to provide beekeeping Typescript classes. The focus to
begin with is on beekeeping basics.

* Environment with location and beehive data
* Bees themselves

Later on, the focus might be opened to include further environmental and
bee related data.

I will actually start a beekeeper training in 2018/2019 and hope to add
learnings from there into the project.

The first application usage will be a UI with local storage. This is
already in the making, but progress is expected to be slow.
